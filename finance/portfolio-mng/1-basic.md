## Time Value of Money

The time value of money means that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum of money in the future (due to its earnings potential in the interim).

### Opportunity Cost

Opportunity cost is key to the concept of the time value of money. Money can grow only if it is invested over time and earns a positive return. Money that is not invested loses value over time. 


### Finding the future value of a cash flow

$$
FV = PV (1 + \frac{i}{n})^{n \times t}
$$

- $FV$: Future value of money
- $PV$: Present value of money
- $i$: Interest rate
- $n$: Number of compounding periods per year
- $t$: Number of years
â€‹

Examples: Let's assume a sum of $10,000 is invested for one year at 10% interest compounded annually. The future value of that money after 1 year is:


$$
FV = 10,000 \times (1 + \frac{10}{1})^{1 \times 1}
 = 11,000
$$


### Finding the present value of a cash flow

$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + \frac{i}{n})^{n \times t}}
$$
