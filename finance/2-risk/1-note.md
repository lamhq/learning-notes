# Measuring Investment Risk

## Calculating a Security's Risk

Risk is the chance of losing money. Variability is the best measure of risk.

Most people prefer to have a good idea about the rate of return they can expect (from a security or a portfolio of securities) and are doing their best to reduce the risk they are exposed to.

Statistical measures to quantify risk are: variance, **standard deviation**


## Portfolio Diversification

You should by stocks from companies operate in different industries (so they are independent).

To measure the relationship between two stocks (variables) we use **correlation**

Correlation between prices and correlation between returns may show different values:

- The correlation between the prices focuses on stock price levels.
- The correlation between the rate of returns reflects the dependence between prices at different times and focuses on the returns of your portfolio. As an investor, returns is what you care about
