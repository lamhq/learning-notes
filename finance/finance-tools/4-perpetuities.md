# Perpetuities

## Perpetuities

### Definition

Perpetuity is a series of equal payments of a fixed amount for an infinite number of periods.

### Formula

$$
V_0 = \frac{C}{r}
$$

- $V_0$: present value
- $C$: constant amount you receive per period
- $r$: interest rate

### Example

How much would you pay for the opportunity to get paid $1000 per year forever, if the interest rate is 10% per year?

$$
V_0 = 1,000 / 0.1 = 10,000
$$


## Growing Perpetuities

### Definition

Perpetuity is a series of payments increasing at a constant growth rate for an infinite number of periods.

### Formula

$$
V_0 = \frac{C}{r - g}
$$

- $V_0$: present value
- $C$: constant amount you receive per period
- $r$: interest rate
- $g$: constant growth rate

### Example

How much would you pay for the opportunity to get paid $1000 per year forever, increasing 5% per year, if the interest rate is 10% per year?

$$
V_0 = 1,000 / (0.1 - 0.05) = 20,000
$$
