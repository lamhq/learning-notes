# Annuities

An annuity is a series of equal fixed payments for a specified number of periods.

Annuity Compound Factor, $ACF(r, n)$, sum up the compounding factors for $n$ payments at a constant interest rate $r$.

$$
ACF(r, n) = \frac{(1+r)^n - 1}{r}
$$

$$
FV_{Ordinary Annuity} = C \times ACF(r, n)
$$

- $FV$: future value of annuity
- $C$: cash flow per period
- $r$: interest rate
- $n$: number of payments

Example of annuities: mortgage payment, car loan payments, bonds payments


## Example

Suppose you have an annual income of $42,000. If you can invest of 5% per year, will you have more than $50,000 at the end of two years?
