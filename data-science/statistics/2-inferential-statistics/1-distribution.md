# Distribution

A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

E.g., the numbers when rolling a die:

| Outcome          | Probability |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6 | 0.17        |
| All else         | 0           |

## Discrete Uniform Distribution

All outcomes have an equal chance of occurring.

## Normal distribution

Reasons to study Normal distribution:

- Normal distribution approximate a wide variety of random variables
- Distributions of **sample means** with large enough sample sizes could be approximated to normal
- All computable statistics are elegant
- Decisions based on Normal distribution insights have a good track record.

$$
N \sim (\mu, \sigma^2)
$$

A lower mean would result in the same shape of the distribubtion, but move it to the left side of the graph. A bigger mean would move the graph to the right.

Changing the standard deviation would not move the graph but reshape it. A lower standard deviation results in a lower dispersion, more data in the middle and **thinner tails**. A higher standard deviation causes the graph to flatten out, less points in the middle and more to the end, **fatter tails**.
