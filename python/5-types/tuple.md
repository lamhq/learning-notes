## Tuples

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])

# convert tuple into a list
y = list(thistuple)

# tuple with one item
thistuple = ("apple",)

# another way to define a tuple
t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
```
