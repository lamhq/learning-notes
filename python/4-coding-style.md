# Coding style

- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
- Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
- Use docstrings
- Use spaces around operators and after commas
- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use `UpperCamelCase` for classes and `lowercase_with_underscores` for functions and methods.
