# Backup and Restore

`pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall` don't have password options.

You may also want to create a `~/.pgpass` file to store all passwords. Alternatively, you can set a password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.

## Back up data

### pg_dump

Use `pg_dump` to back up specific databases

`pg_dump` can selectively back up tables, schemas, and databases.

`pg_dump` can back up to plain SQL, as well as compressed, TAR, and directory formats.

Compressed, TAR, and directory format backups can take advantage of the parallel restore feature of `pg_restore`.

Directory backups allow parallel `pg_dump` of a large database.

The directory format option backs up each table as a separate file in a folder and gets around file size limitations, results in multiple files.


**Create a compressed, single database backup:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F c -b -v -f mydb.backup mydb
```

**Create a plain-text single database backup:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -C -F p -b -v -f mydb.backup mydb
```

**Create a compressed backup of tables whose names start with `pay` in any schema**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F c -b -v -t *.pay* -f pay.backup mydb
```

**Create a compressed backup of all objects in the `hr` and `payroll` schemas:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F c -b -v \
  -n hr -n payroll -f hr.backup mydb
```

**Create a compressed backup of all objects in all schemas, excluding the public schema:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F c -b -v -N public \
  -f all_sch_except_pub.backup mydb
```

**Create a plain-text SQL backup:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F p --column-inserts \
  -f select_tables.backup mydb
```

**Create a directory format backup:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -F d -f /somepath/a_directory mydb
```

**Directory format parallel backup:**

```sh
pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U someuser -j 3 -Fd -f /somepath/a_directory mydb
```


### pg_dumpall

Use `pg_dumpall` to back up all databases on a server into a single plain-text file.

Restoring from a huge plain-text backup tries our patience.

**Back up all globals and tablespace definitions only:**

```sh
pg_dumpall -h localhost -U postgres --port=5432 -f myglobals.sql -- globals-only
```

**Back up specific global settings:**

```sh
pg_dumpall -h localhost -U postgres --port=5432 -f myroles.sql --roles- only
```


### pg_basebackup

Use `pg_basebackup` to do system-level disk backup of all databases.

`pg_basebackup` is the most efficient way of doing a full postgresql server cluster backup.

If you have a reasonably sized database, as in 500 GB or more, you should be using `pg_basebackup` as part of your backup strategy.


## Restoring Data

- Use `psql` to restore plain-text backups generated with `pg_dumpall` or `pg_dump`.
- Use `pg_restore` to restore compressed, TAR, and directory backups created with `pg_dump`.

### psql

**restore a backup and ignore errors:**

```sh
psql -U postgres -f myglobals.sql
```

**stopping if any error is found:**

```sh
psql -U postgres --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on -f myglobals.sql
```

**restore to a specific database:**

```sh
psql -U postgres -d mydb -f select_objects.sql
```


### pg_restore

- You can perform parallel restores using the `-j`, significantly picking up the pace of what could otherwise be a lengthy process.
- `pg_restore` allows you to selectively restore, even from within a backup of a full database.
- If you have data in the database, and you want to replace it with whatâ€™s in the backup, you need to add the `--clean` switch 


To perform a restore using pg_restore, first create a new database, the restore:

```sh
pg_restore --dbname=mydb --jobs=4 --verbose mydb.backup
```

**Create and restore the database in one step:**

```sh
pg_restore --dbname=postgres --create --jobs=4 --verbose mydb.backup
```

you can take advantage of the --section option to restore just the structure without the data:

```sh
pg_restore --dbname=mydb2 --section=pre-data --jobs=4 mydb.backup
```
