# Integer Data Types

To store the whole numbers in PostgreSQL, you use one of the following integer types: `SMALLINT`, `INTEGER`, and `BIGINT`.

PostgreSQL does not provide unsigned integer types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    pages SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (pages > 0)
);

CREATE TABLE cities (
    city_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    city_name VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL,
    population INT NOT NULL CHECK (population >= 0)
);
```

## `SERIAL` Types

`Serial` and its bigger sibling, `bigserial`, are auto-incrementing integers often used as primary keys of tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE tablename (
    colname SERIAL
);
```

When you create a table and specify a column as `serial`, PostgreSQL first creates an `integer` column and then creates a sequence object named `table_name_column_name_seq` located in the same schema as the table.

It then sets the default of the new integer column to read its value from the sequence. If you drop the column, PostgreSQL also drops the companion sequence object.

You can use the same sequence across multiple tables. The cross-table sharing of the same sequence comes in handy when youâ€™re assigning a universal key in your database.

**Using existing sequence for new tables:**

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE s START 1;
CREATE TABLE stuff(
  id bigint DEFAULT nextval('s') PRIMARY KEY, 
  name text
);
```

## Generate Series Function

PostgreSQL has a nifty function called `generate_series`. It allows you to effectively mimic a for loop in SQL

The function comes in two forms:
- One is a numeric version that creates a sequence of integers incremented by some value
- one that creates a sequence of dates or timestamps incremented by some time interval.

```
generate_series(default, max, step)
```

```sql
SELECT x FROM generate_series(1,51,13) As x;
```

```
