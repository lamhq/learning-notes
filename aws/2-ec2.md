# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

## What Is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to provision virtual servers called EC2 instances.

In order to create an EC2 instance, you need to define:

- Hardware specifications, like CPU, memory, network, and storage.
- Logical configurations, like networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice.

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

You will see something like this when selecting an instance type and size. The `T3` or `A1` is the instance family that determines the blend of the hardware capabilities. Then there's the dot. Then there's the size like `small`, `medium`, `large`:

- `t3.medium`
- `a1.large`

## What Is an AMI?

AMI let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.

The AMI is how you model and define your instance, while the EC2 instance is the entity you interact with, where you can install your web server, and serve your content to users.

When you launch a new instance, AWS allocates a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. Then the AMI you selected is copied to the root device volume, which contains the image used to boot the volume. In the end, you get a server you can connect to and install packages and any additional software. In this case, you install a web server along with the properly configured source code of your employee directory app.

One advantage of using AMIs is that they are reusable. You can create an AMI from your running instance and use this AMI to start a new instance. This way, your new instance will have all the same configurations as your current instance, because the configurations set in the AMIs are the same.
