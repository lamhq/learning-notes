# Serverless and AWS Lambda

If you run your code on Amazon EC2, AWS is responsible for the physical hardware and you are responsible for the logical controls, such as guest operating system, security and patching, networking, security, and scaling.

If you run your code in containers on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, AWS is responsible for more of the container management, such as deploying containers across EC2 instances and managing the container cluster. However, when running ECS and EKS on EC2, you are still responsible for maintaining the underlying EC2 instances.

If you want to deploy your workloads and applications without having to manage any EC2 instances, you can do that on AWS with serverless compute.

Every definition of serverless mentions four aspects:

- No servers to provision or manage.
- Scales with usage.
- You never pay for idle resources.
- Availability and fault tolerance are built-in.

AWS has several serverless compute options, including AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda.

## Serverless Containers with AWS Fargate

Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS enable you to run your containers in two modes:

- Amazon EC2 mode
- AWS Fargate mode

AWS Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance so youâ€™re not required to manage it.

It natively integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 

Having native integration with Amazon VPC allows you to launch Fargate containers inside your network and control connectivity to your applications.

## Run Your Code on AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers or containers.

AWS Lambda requires zero administration from the user. You upload your source code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.
