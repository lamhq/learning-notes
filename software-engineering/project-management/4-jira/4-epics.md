# Working with epics in company-managed projects

## Step 1: Create a new epic in Jira Software

There are three ways to create epics in Jira Software:

- Roadmap: enable **Roadmap** in **Board settings**
- Backlog
- Global Create issue button


## Step 2: Add stories or child-issues

Stories, bugs, and tasks describe a single piece of work, while epics are used to describe a group of issues that all relate to the same, larger body of work. 

Epics are typically completed over several sprints, or a longer time frame if you don't use sprints.


## Step 3: Viewing your epics

You can see information relating to all your epics in the Backlog.


## Step 4: Set up swimlanes for your epics on your board

During a sprint, you might find it useful to divide your board into swimlanes for each epic, to make the board visually clearer.

You can set this up in **Board settings** > **Swimlanes**.


## Step 5: Monitor the progress of your epic

In Jira Software, you can use the Epic Report to track the amount of work remaining over time so you can estimate when the epic will be completed.


## Step 6: Complete your epic

Click the status drop-down in the detail view of an epic and select **Mark as Done**.
