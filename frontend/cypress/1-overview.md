# Overview

## Why Cypress?

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. This enables you to **write faster**, **easier** and **more reliable** tests.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Component tests
- Integration tests
- Unit tests

Cypress is most often compared to **Selenium**; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.

You'll often wonder if you're using best practices or scalable strategies.

To guide the way, the Cypress team has created the Real World App (RWA), a full stack example application that demonstrates testing with **Cypress in practical and realistic scenarios**.
