# End-to-End Testing

## Add a test file

We're going to do this with the Create new empty spec button in [The Launchpad](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app#The-Launchpad).


## Visit a page

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
  })
})
```


## Query for an element

```js
it('finds the content "type"', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

  cy.contains('type')
})
```

- `cy.get()`: select an element based on its class


## Click an element

```js
cy.contains('type').click()
```


## Make an assertion

```js
cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')
```


## Page Transitions

Cypress automatically detects things like a page transition event and will automatically halt running commands until the next page has finished loading.

You don't have to worry about commands accidentally running against a stale page, nor do you have to worry about running commands against a partially loaded page.

Cypress waited **4 seconds** before timing out finding a DOM element - but when Cypress detects a **page transition event**, it automatically increases the timeout to **60 seconds** for the single **PAGE LOAD** event.

Based on the commands and the events happening, Cypress automatically alters its expected timeouts to match web application behavior.
