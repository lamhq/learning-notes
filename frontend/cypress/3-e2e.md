# End-to-End Testing

## Add a test file

We're going to do this with the Create new empty spec button in [The Launchpad](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app#The-Launchpad).


## Visit a page

```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
  })
})
```


## Query for an element

```js
it('finds the content "type"', () => {
  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')

  cy.contains('type')
})
```

- `cy.get()`: select an element based on its class


## Interaction

```js
cy.contains('type').click()
```


## Make an assertion

```js
cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')
```


## Page Transitions

Cypress automatically detects things like a page transition event and will automatically halt running commands until the next page has finished loading.

You don't have to worry about commands accidentally running against a stale page, nor do you have to worry about running commands against a partially loaded page.

Cypress waited **4 seconds** before timing out finding a DOM element - but when Cypress detects a **page transition event**, it automatically increases the timeout to **60 seconds** for the single **PAGE LOAD** event.

Based on the commands and the events happening, Cypress automatically alters its expected timeouts to match web application behavior.


## Seeding data

Traditionally when writing e2e tests using Selenium, before you automate the browser you do some kind of **set up and tear down** on the server.

Perhaps you'll need to generate a user, and seed them with associations and records. You may be familiar with using things such as fixtures or factories.

You generally have three ways to facilitate this with Cypress:

- `cy.exec()` - to run system commands
- `cy.task()` - to run code in Node via the setupNodeEvents function
- `cy.request()` - to make HTTP requests

```js
describe('The Home Page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // reset and seed the database prior to every test
    cy.exec('npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed')

    // seed a post in the DB that we control from our tests
    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/post', {
      title: 'First Post',
      authorId: 1,
      body: '...',
    })

    // seed a user in the DB that we can control from our tests
    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/user', { name: 'Jane' })
      .its('body')
      .as('currentUser')
  })

  it('successfully loads', () => {
    // this.currentUser will now point to the response
    // body of the cy.request() that we could use
    // to log in or work with in some way

    cy.visit('/')
  })
})
```

While there's nothing really wrong with this approach, it does add a lot of complexity. You will be battling synchronizing the state between your server and your browser (tests may build up state that may affect other tests) and you'll always need to set up / tear down this state before tests (which is slow).

**With Cypress, there are several other approaches that can offer an arguably better and faster experience.**


## Stubbing the server

Another valid approach opposed to seeding and talking to your server is to bypass it altogether.

While you'll still receive all of the regular HTML / JS / CSS assets from your server, you can instead **stub** the JSON responses coming from it.

Another upside is that this enables you to build out your application **without needing the contract of the server to exist**, even test all of the edge cases.

While stubbing is great, it means that **you don't have the guarantees that these response payloads actually match what the server will send**. However, there are still many valid ways to get around this:

- **Generate the fixture stubs ahead of time**. You could have the server generate all of the fixture stubs for you ahead of time. This means their data will reflect what the server will actually send.
- **Write a single e2e test without stubs, and then stub the rest**. Integrate both strategies, you likely want to have a single test that takes a true e2e approach and stubs nothing. Once you've established it's working you can then use stubs to test all of the edge cases and additional scenarios.

We recommend that the vast majority of tests use stub data. They will be orders of magnitude faster, and much less complex.


## Logging in

All the good parts of your application most likely require an authenticated user. Here are some tips:

### Fully test the login flow -- but only once

We recommend you test signup and login using your UI as a real user would.

```js
describe('The Login Page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // reset and seed the database prior to every test
    cy.exec('npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed')

    // seed a user in the DB that we can control from our tests
    // assuming it generates a random password for us
    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/user', { username: 'jane.lane' })
      .its('body')
      .as('currentUser')
  })

  it('sets auth cookie when logging in via form submission', function () {
    // destructuring assignment of the this.currentUser object
    const { username, password } = this.currentUser

    cy.visit('/login')

    cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)

    // {enter} causes the form to submit
    cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`)

    // we should be redirected to /dashboard
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')

    // our auth cookie should be present
    cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')

    // UI should reflect this user being logged in
    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'jane.lane')
  })
})
```

You'll likely also want to test your login UI for:

- Invalid username / password
- Username taken
- Password complexity requirements
- Edge cases like locked / deleted accounts


### Reusing the login code

You could put all the login code to one big spec file and call the code in a `beforeEach` block. But this approaches is not maintainable, and certainly not very elegant.

A much better solution is to write a custom `cy.login()` command. Lets make the above login example a custom command and add it to `cypress/support/commands.js` so it can be leveraged in any spec file:

```js
// In cypress/support/commands.js

Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {
  cy.visit('/login')

  cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)

  // {enter} causes the form to submit
  cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`, { log: false })

  // we should be redirected to /dashboard
  cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')

  // our auth cookie should be present
  cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')

  // UI should reflect this user being logged in
  cy.get('h1').should('contain', username)
})

// In your spec file

it('does something on a secured page', function () {
  const { username, password } = this.currentUser
  cy.login(username, password)

  // ...rest of test
})
```

### Login once

Cypress provides the `cy.session()` command, a powerful performance tool that lets you cache the browser context associated with your user and reuse it for multiple tests without going through multiple login flows:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {
  cy.session(
    username,
    () => {
      cy.visit('/login')
      cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)
      cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`, { log: false })
      cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')
      cy.get('h1').should('contain', username)
    },
    {
      validate: () => {
        cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')
      },
    }
  )
})
```

**Third-Party Login**:

If your app implements login via a third-party authentication provider such as Auth0 or Okta, you can use the `cy.origin()` command to include their login pages as part of your authentication tests.
