# Installation

The preferred way to manage Yarn is through Corepack, a new binary shipped with all Node.js releases starting from 16.10.

With Node.js >=16.10, Corepack is included by default with all Node.js installs, but is currently opt-in. To enable it, run the following command:

```sh
corepack enable
```
