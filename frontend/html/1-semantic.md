# HTML Semantics

## What does Semantic in HTML mean?

Semantics is the use of HTML tags that accurately reflect the content they contain.
 
For instance, using the `<div>` tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however using the `<p>` tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information. 

The purpose of using semantic tags in HTML is to organize your HTML script based on the meaning of the HTML element rather than how it looks.

## Why write semantic HTML?

By using semantic HTML, this provides a number of advantages, including SEO, Accessibility, Compatibility, and Code maintainability.  

### SEO

HTML semantic elements are now included in Google’s algorithms. Because search engines utilize HTML to decipher the content and goal of a webpage, its placement of semantic keywords has an impact on the webpage’s ranking.


### Accessibility

It is easier for persons with disabilities to navigate your website if you have appropriately laid up a foundation of semantic HTML.


### Browser Compatibility

HTML semantic tags make sure that your code can be integrated with future technologies.

Additionally, each browser interacts with semantic elements differently, semantic elements make it simple to utilize larger coverage of your website across platforms.


## HTML Semantic Tags

Some of the most commonly used semantic HTML tags include

- `<header>`: The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section
- `<nav>`: The navigation tag is used for navigation links. It can be nested within the `<header>` tag, but secondary navigation `<nav>` tags are also commonly used elsewhere on the page.
- `<main>`: This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page. There should be only one tag per page.
- `<section>`: Using `<section>` is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. 
- `<article>`: The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.
- `<aside>`: An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.
- `<footer>`: You use `<footer`> at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information, copyright information, and some site navigation.
