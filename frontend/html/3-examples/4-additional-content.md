# Additional Content (`aside`)

An additional content, unimportant for understanding an article, but related to the article, can be inserted into the `aside` section.

*It could be information about how many people read the article, who is the author of the article, and so on.*

```html
<main>
    <article>
        <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a rich and expressive language...</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Syntax Basics</h2>
            <p>Understanding statements, variable naming, whitespace...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Operators</h2>
            <p>Operators allow you to manipulate values...</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conditional Code</h2>
            <p>Sometimes you only want to run a block of code under certain conditions...</p>
        </section>  
        <aside>
            <p>Viewed by 1503 people</p>
            <p>Author: John Smith</p>
        </aside>
    </article>
</main>
```

This tag can be also used to enclose additional content that is related to a whole page, not just to a particular article.

*For example, aside can wrap a sidebar, ad, footnote, and so on.*
