# Introducing Google Cloud

## Cloud computing overview

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Five equally important traits:

- customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.
- customers get access to those resources over the Internet, from anywhere.
- cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool.
- resources are elastic, if customers need more resources, they can get more and quickly.
- customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go.


## SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS

### SaaS: Software as a Service

Applications aren't installed on your local computer. Instead, they run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users.

Characteristics:
- customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time


Examples:
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs and Drive)
- Dropbox
- Salesforce
- Cisco WebEx
- Concur
- GoToMeeting.

When to Use SaaS:
- Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don't have time for server issues or software
- Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration
- Applications that aren't needed too often
- Applications that need both web and mobile access

Limitations:

- Interoperability. Integration with existing apps and services
- Vendor lock-in
- Lack of integration support
- Data security
- Customization
- Lack of control
- Feature limitations.
- Performance and downtime.


### PaaS: Platform as a Service

Provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications.

Characteristics:
- Customers pay for the resources they actually use
- Resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
- Integrates web services and databases

Limitations:
- Data security
- Integrations
- Vendor lock-in
- Customization of legacy systems
- Runtime issues
- Operational limitation

Examples:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Windows Azure
- Heroku
- Force.com
- Google App Engine
- OpenShift

### IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS offerings provide raw compute, storage and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers.

IaaS allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed.

IaaS clients are responsible for managing aspects such as applications, runtime, OSes, middleware, and data.

Providers of the IaaS manage the servers, hard drives, networking, virtualization, and storage.


## The Google Cloud network

Google Cloudâ€™s infrastructure is based in five major geographic **locations**: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Each of these locations is divided into several different **regions** and zones. Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of **zones**.

A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed. 

You can run resources in different regions. This is useful for bringing applications closer to users around the world, and also for protection in case there are issues with an entire region, say, due to a natural disaster.

## Pricing and billing

Google was the first major cloud provider to deliver **per-second billing** for its infrastructure as a service compute offering compute engine.

Compute Engine offers automatically applied sustained-use discounts which are **automatic discounts** that you get for running a virtual machine instance for a significant portion of the billing month. Specifically, when you run an instance for more than 25% of a month, Compute Engine automatically gives you a discount for every incremental minute you use for that instance.

You can define **budgets** at the billing account level or at the project level. A budget can be a fixed limit or it can be tied to another metric, for example, a percentage of the previous month spent.

To be notified when costs approach your budget limit, you can create an **alert**.

Google Cloud also implements **quotas** which are designed to prevent the over consumption of resources. There are two types of quotas, rate quotas and allocation quotas, applied at the project level. Rate quotas reset after a specific time. Allocation quotas govern the number of resources you can have in your projects.
