# AWS Cost Explorer

[AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data.

For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.
