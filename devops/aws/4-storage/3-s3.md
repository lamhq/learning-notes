# Object Storage with Amazon S3

## What Is Amazon S3?

Unlike Amazon EBS, Amazon S3 is a standalone storage solution that isn't tied to compute. It enables you to retrieve your data from anywhere on the web.

Amazon S3 is an **object storage** service. Object storage stores data in a flat structure, using unique identifiers to look up objects when requested.

An object is simply a file combined with metadata.


## Understand Amazon S3 Concepts

In Amazon S3, you have to store your objects in containers called buckets.

When you create a bucket, you choose, at the very minimum, two things: the bucket name and the AWS Region you want the bucket to reside in.

AWS stops you from choosing a **bucket name** that has already been chosen by someone else in another AWS account.

Note, you can have folders inside of buckets to help you organize objects. However, remember that there's no actual file hierarchy that supports this on the back end. It is instead a flat structure where all files and folders live at the same level. Using buckets and folders implies a hierarchy, which makes it easy to understand for the human eye.

## S3 Use Cases

**Backup and storage**: S3 is a natural place to back up files because it is highly redundant. As mentioned in the last unit, AWS stores your EBS snapshots in S3 to take advantage of its high availability.

**Media hosting**: Because you can store unlimited objects, and each individual object can be up to 5 TBs, S3 is an ideal location to host video, photo, or music uploads.

**Software delivery**: You can use S3 to host your software applications that customers can download.

**Data lakes**: S3 is an optimal foundation for a data lake because of its virtually unlimited scalability. You can increase storage from gigabytes to petabytes of content, paying only for what you use.

**Static websites**: You can configure your bucket to host a static website of HTML, CSS, and client-side scripts.

**Static content**: Because of the limitless scaling, the support for large files, and the fact that you access any object over the web at any time, S3 is the perfect place to store static content.

## Security

Everything in Amazon S3 is private by default. All S3 resources, such as buckets, folders, and objects can only be viewed by the user or AWS account that created that resource.

If you decide that you want everyone on the internet to see your photos, you can choose to make your buckets, folders, and objects public.

Most of the time, you don't want your permissions to be all or nothing. Typically, you want to be more granular about the way you provide access to your resources.

To be more specific about who can do what with your S3 resources, Amazon S3 provides two main access management features: **IAM policies** and **S3 bucket policies**.

### IAM Policies

When IAM policies are attached to IAM users, groups, and roles, the policies define which actions they can perform.

You should use IAM policies for private buckets when:

- You have many buckets with different permission requirements. Instead of defining many different S3 bucket policies, you can use IAM policies instead.
- You want all policies to be in a centralized location. Using IAM policies allows you to manage all policy information in one location.


### S3 Bucket Policies

S3 bucket policies are similar to IAM policies, in that they are both defined using the same policy language in a JSON format.

The difference is IAM policies are attached to users, groups, and roles, whereas S3 bucket policies are only attached to buckets.

S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on the bucket.

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Sid":"PublicRead",
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Principal":"*",
      "Action":[
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource":[
        "arn:aws:s3:::employeebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

S3 Bucket policies can only be placed on buckets, and cannot be used for folders or objects. However, the policy that is placed on the bucket applies to every object in that bucket.

You should use S3 bucket policies when:

- You need a simple way to do cross-account access to S3, without using IAM roles.
- Your IAM policies bump up against the defined size limit. S3 bucket policies have a larger size limit.


## Encrypt

Amazon S3 reinforces encryption in transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest.

To protect data at rest, you can use:

- Server-side encryption: This allows Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and then decrypt it when you download the objects.
- Client-side encryption: Encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and all related tools.

To encrypt in transit, you can use client-side encryption or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).


## Versioning

If you don't use Amazon S3 versioning, anytime you upload an object called `employee.jpg` to the `employees` folder, it overwrites the original file.

This can be an issue for several reasons:

- `employee.jpg` is a common name for an employee photo object. You or someone else who has access to that bucket might not have intended to overwrite it, and now that you have, you no longer have access to the original file.
- You may want to preserve different versions of `employee.jpg`. Without versioning, if you wanted to create a new version of `employee.jpg`, you would need to upload the object and choose a different name for it. Having several objects all with slight differences in naming variations may cause confusion and clutter in your bucket.

If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. In one bucket, for example, you can have two objects with the same key, but different version IDs, such as `employeephoto.gif` (version `111111`) and `employeephoto.gif` (version `121212`).

Versioning-enabled buckets let you recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.

- Deleting an object does not remove the object permanently. Instead, Amazon S3 puts a marker on the object that shows you tried to delete it. If you want to restore the object, you can remove this marker and it reinstates the object.
- If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You still have access to previous versions of the object.

**Versioning States**:

Buckets can be in one of three states:

- Unversioned (the default): No new or existing objects in the bucket have a version.
- Versioning-enabled: This enables versioning for all objects in the bucket.
- Versioning-suspended: This suspends versioning for new objects. All new objects in the bucket will not have a version. However, all existing objects keep their object versions.

The versioning state applies to all of the objects in that bucket. Keep in mind that storage costs are incurred for all objects in your bucket and all versions of those objects. To reduce your S3 bill, you may want to delete previous versions of your objects that are no longer in use.

## Storage Classes

S3 storage classes let you change your storage tier as your data characteristics change. For example, if you are now accessing your old photos infrequently, you may want to change the storage class those photos are stored in to save on costs.

There are six S3 storage classes:

**Amazon S3 Standard**: This is considered general purpose storage for cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics.

**Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering**: This tier is useful if your data has unknown or changing access patterns. S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two tiers, a frequent access tier and an infrequent access tier. Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of your data, and automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on frequency of access.

**Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)**: S3 Standard-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee. This storage tier is ideal if you want to store long-term backups, disaster recovery files, and so on.

**Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)**: Unlike other S3 storage classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It's a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or easily re-creatable data.

**Amazon S3 Glacier**: S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours.

**Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice in a year. It is designed for customersâ€”particularly those in highly regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Public Sectorsâ€”that retain data sets for 7 to 10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements.


## Automate Tier Transitions

If you keep manually changing your objects, you may want to look into automating this process using a lifecycle policy.

When you define a lifecycle policy configuration for an object or group of objects, you can choose to automate two actions: transition and expiration actions.

- **Transition actions** are used to define when you should transition your objects to another storage class.
- **Expiration actions** define when objects expire and should be permanently deleted.

*For example, you might choose to transition objects to S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or archive objects to the S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them.*

The following use cases are good candidates for lifecycle management:

- **Periodic logs**: If you upload periodic logs to a bucket, your application might need them for a week or a month. After that, you might want to delete them.
- **Data that changes in access frequency**: Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of time. After that, they are infrequently accessed. At some point, you might not need real-time access to them, but your organization or regulations might require you to archive them for a specific period. After that, you can delete them.
