# Amazon Kinesis Video Streams

## Overview

If you need to stream media content from a large number of devices to AWS and then run analytics, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing, consider using Kinesis Video Streams. A perfect example of this is Ring.

Kinesis Video Streams elastically scales to millions of devices and then stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in your streams. You can then access your data through easy-to-use APIs.


## Use cases

- Smart Home. Think Amazon Ring. You can stream video content from your Ring devices to Kinesis Video Streams and then run analysis on the data.
- Smart City. Many cities have devices like CCTV cameras at traffic lights and junctions that can be monitored automatically using Kinesis Streams.
- Industrial Automation. You can use Kinesis Streams to ingest time-encoded data (e.g., LIDAR and RADAR signals and temperature sensors) and then provide industrial automation.


Amazon Kinesis Video Streams allows secure streaming of video from connected devices to AWS for various purposes like analytics, machine learning, playback, etc.

The service automatically provisions and scales the infrastructure required to ingest streaming video data from millions of devices.

Kinesis Video Streams stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in streams, and provides access through APIs. It supports playback of both live and on-demand video viewing.

You can also use it to quickly build applications that take advantage of computer vision and video analytics through integration with Amazon Rekognition Video and libraries for ML frameworks (such as Apache MXNet, TensorFlow, and OpenCV)

Kinesis Video Streams also supports WebRTC, allowing real-time media streaming and interaction between web browsers, mobile apps, and connected devices. WebRTC is commonly used for activities like video chat and peer-to-peer media streaming.
