# AWS Certificate Manager

## Overview

AWS Certificate Manager allows you to create, manage, and deploy public and private SSL certificates for use with other AWS services.

It integrates with other services - such as Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront distributions, and API Gateway - allowing you to easily manage and deploy SSL certificates in your AWS environment.

## Benefits

**Cost**. Free service. No more paying for SSL certificates! AWS Certificate Manager provisions both public and private certificates for free. You will still pay for the resources that utilize your certificates (such as Elastic Load Balancing).

**Automated Renewals and Deployment**. Certificate Manager can automate the renewal of your SSL certificate and then automatically update the new certificate with ACM-integrated services, such as Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, and API Gateway.

**Easier to Set Up**. Removes a lot of the manual process, such as generating a key pair or creating a certificate signing request (CS). You can create your own SSL certificate with just a few clicks in the AWS
Management Console.
