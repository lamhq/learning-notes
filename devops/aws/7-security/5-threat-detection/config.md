# AWS Config

This service records your AWS configuration, changes to that configuration, or a history, and even change notifications, so you're notified proactively.

It will discover these existing AWS resources and generate a full inventory, along with all the actual configuration details, for you. You can then determine how a resource was configured at any point in time.

You can tie this into the aforementioned AWS CloudTrail, so that you gain full visibility into who made the actual change at that point in time and what the change was.
