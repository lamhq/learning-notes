# Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads.

The service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.

GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or hardware to deploy or maintain.
