# AWS Transfer Family?

## Overview

The AWS Transfer Family allows you to easily move files in and out of S3 or EFS using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or the File Transfer
Protocol (FTP).

The AWS Transfer Family excels when you have a collection of older applications using protocols that cannot be changed. You can easily "trick" these applications into using S3 storage.
