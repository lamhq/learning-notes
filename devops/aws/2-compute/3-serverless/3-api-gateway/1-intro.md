# Amazon API Gateway

API Gateway is a fully managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale. APIs serve as the front door for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services.

Amazon API Gateway integrates with Lambda to expose the Lambda function as a backend service.

API Gateway enables the creation of RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs for real-time two-way communication applications.

Customers can add authentication to API Gateway for enhanced security.

There are no minimum fees or startup costs associated with API Gateway.
