# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

The three main categories of compute are **virtual machines**, **containers**, and **serverless**.

## What Is Amazon EC2?

Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to provision **virtual servers** called EC2 instances.

In order to create an EC2 instance, you need to define:

- Hardware specifications, like CPU, memory, network, and storage.
- Logical configurations, like networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice.


## How Amazon EC2 works?

### Launch

First, you launch an instance. Begin by **selecting a template** with basic configurations for your instance.

These configurations include the **operating system**, application server, or applications.

You also select the **instance type**, which is the specific hardware configuration of your instance.

As you are preparing to launch an instance, you specify **security settings** to control the network traffic that can flow into and out of your instance.

### Connect

Your programs and applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance and exchange data.

Users can also connect to the instance by logging in and accessing the computer desktop.

### Use

After you have connected to the instance, you can run commands to install software, add storage, copy and organize files, and more.


## Instance Types

AWS has different types of EC2 Instances that you can spun up and deploy into AWS environment. Each instance type is grouped under an **instance family** and are optimized for certain types of tasks.

Instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. They give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.


## Instance Families

The different instance families in EC2 are:

### General purpose

Provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources.

Use cases:
- application servers
- gaming servers
- backend servers for enterprise applications
- small and medium databases


### Compute optimized

Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors

Use cases:

- high-performance web servers
- compute-intensive applications servers
- scientific modeling
- batch processing
- distributed analytics
- high-performance computing (HPC)
- machine/deep learning, ad serving
- highly scalable multiplayer gaming

### Memory optimized

Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

Use cases:
- high-performance databases
- distributed web-scale in-memory caches
- mid-size in-memory databases
- real-time big-data analytics
- other enterprise applications.

### Accelerated computing

Use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.

Use cases:
- floating-point number calculations
- data pattern matching
- game streaming
- application streaming
- graphics processing, video encoding
- 3D visualizations, 3D rendering
- graphics-intensive remote workstations

### Storage optimized

Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage.

Examples of workloads suitable for storage optimized instances include distributed file systems, data warehousing applications, and high-frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.

> In computing, the term input/output operations per second (IOPS) is a metric that measures the performance of a storage device. It indicates how many different input or output operations a device can perform in one second.
>
> Storage optimized instances are designed to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random IOPS to applications.

Use cases:
- NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and Redis
- in-memory databases
- scale-out transactional databases
- data warehousing, Elasticsearch, and analytics. |


## Pricing

Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases.

### On-Demand

The instances run continuously until you stop them, and you pay for only the compute time you use.

Ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted.

Use cases:

- developing and testing applications
- running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns.

Not recommended for workloads that last a year or longer because these workloads can experience greater cost savings using **Reserved Instances**.


### Amazon EC2 Savings Plans

Enable you to reduce your compute costs by committing to a consistent amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term.

This results in savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs.

- Any usage **up to the commitment** is charged at the discounted Savings Plan rate (for example, $10 an hour).
- Any usage **beyond the commitment** is charged at regular On-Demand rates.


### Reserved Instances

Reserved Instances are a **billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances** in your account.

You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term, and Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term.

At the end of a Reserved Instance term, you can continue using the Amazon EC2 instance without interruption. However, you are charged On-Demand rates until you do one of the following:

- Terminate the instance.
- Purchase a new Reserved Instance that matches the instance attributes (instance type, Region, tenancy, and platform).


### Spot Instances

Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity.

If you make a Spot request and Amazon EC2 capacity is available, your Spot Instance launches. However, if Amazon EC2 capacity is unavailable, the request is not successful until capacity becomes available.

Your Spot Instance runs until you stop or terminate it, or until Amazon EC2 interrupts it (when the demand for Spot Instances rises or when the supply of Spot Instances decreases). 

When the instance is interrupted, it either terminates, stops, or hibernates depending on the interruption behavior that you choose.

Spot Instancesoffer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.

They are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times, or that can withstand interruptions, such as background processing job.


### Dedicated Hosts

Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. 

Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.

You can purchase On-Demand Dedicated Hosts and Dedicated Hosts Reservations.


## AMI?

When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is which operating system you want by selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

AMI let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.

The AMI is how you model and define your instance, while the EC2 instance is the entity you interact with, where you can install your web server, and serve your content to users.

When you launch a new instance, AWS allocates a virtual machine that runs on a hypervisor. Then the AMI you selected is copied to the root device volume, which contains the image used to boot the volume. In the end, you get a server you can connect to and install packages and any additional software. In this case, you install a web server along with the properly configured source code of your employee directory app.

One advantage of using AMIs is that they are reusable. You can create an AMI from your running instance and use this AMI to start a new instance. This way, your new instance will have all the same configurations as your current instance, because the configurations set in the AMIs are the same.

## What Makes Up an EC2 Instance?

EC2 instances are a combination of virtual processors (vCPUs), memory, network, and in some cases, instance storage and graphics processing units (GPUs)

Instance types consist of a prefix identifying the type of workloads they're optimized for, followed by a size.

For example, the instance type `c5.large` can be broken down into the following elements.

- `c5` determines the instance family and generation number. Here, the instance belongs to the fifth generation of instances in an instance family that's optimized for generic computation.
- `large`, which determines the amount of instance capacity.


## EC2 Instance Lifecycle

When the instance is **pending** (1), billing has not started.

When your instance is **running** (2), it's ready to use. This is also the stage where billing begins.

When you **stop and start** an instance (4), your instance may be placed on a new underlying physical server. Therefore, you lose any data on the instance store that were on the previous host computer. When you stop an instance, the instance gets a new public IP address but maintains the same private IP address.

When you stop your instance, it enters the **stopping** state, and then the **stopped** state. AWS does not charge usage or data transfer fees for your instance after you stop it, but storage for any Amazon EBS volumes is still charged. While your instance is in the stopped state, you can modify some attributes, like the instance type. When you stop your instance, the data stored in memory (RAM) is lost.

When you **terminate** an instance (5), the instance store are erased, and you lose both the public IP address and private IP address of the machine. Termination of an instance means you can no longer access the machine.
