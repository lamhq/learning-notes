# Apache Cassandra & Amazon Keyspaces

## Apache Cassandra

A distributed database that uses NoSQL. It's primarily used for big data solutions.

Enterprises, such as Netflix, use Cassandra on their backend.


## Amazon Keyspaces

It's Amazon's Apache Cassandra database service. It allows you to run Cassandra workloads on AWS and is a fully managed database service.

Keyspaces is serverless.

When migrating a big data Cassandra cluster to AWS, think of Amazon Keyspaces.
