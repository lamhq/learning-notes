# Overview

## Relational databases

In a relational database, data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data. 

Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) to store and query data.


## OLTP and OLAP

### OLTP

Processes data from transactions in real time (e.g., customer orders, banking transactions, payments, and booking systems).

OLTP is all about data processing and completing large numbers of small transactions in real time.

### OLAP

Processes complex queries to analyze historical data (e.g. analyzing net profit figures from the past 3 years and sales forecasting).

OLAP is all about data analysis using large amounts of data, as well as complex queries that take a long time to complete.

Examples:

- **Net Profit Analysis**: You have been asked to produce a report comparing net profits for car sales in 3 different regions.
- **Large Amounts of Data**:
  - Sum of cars sold in each region
  - Unit cost for each region
  - Sales price of each car
  - Sales price compared to the unit cost
