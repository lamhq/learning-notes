# Data storage services

## Data lake

A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis.

You can use a data lake to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.


## AWS Lake Formation

Athena is serverless, you pay only for the queries that you run.

To use Athena, you point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying by using standard SQL. You donâ€™t need complex extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs to prepare your data for analysis.


## Amazon EMR

Amazon EMR is a big data solution for petabyte-scale data processing, interactive analytics, and machine learning that use open-source frameworks, such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Presto.

Amazon EMR requires a learning curve to operate the open-source frameworks that it uses.

Use cases:

- Run large-scale data processing and what-if analysis by using statistical algorithms and predictive models to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, market trends, and customer preferences.
- Extract data from various sources, process it at scale, and make the data available for applications and users.
- Analyze events from streaming data sources in real time to create long-running, highly available, and fault-tolerant streaming data pipelines.
- Analyze data using open-source ML frameworks, such as Apache Spark MLlib, TensorFlow, and Apache MXNet.
- Connect to Amazon SageMaker Studio for large-scale model training, analysis, and reporting.


## Amazon OpenSearch Service

Amazon OpenSearch Service is the successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service.

You can use Amazon OpenSearch Service to perform interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, website search, and more. 

OpenSearch is an open source, distributed search and analytics suite that is derived from Elasticsearch.
