# Installation

The `@testing-library` family of packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way.

## Core

yarn add --dev @testing-library/dom
```


## For React

No need to install `@testing-library/dom`

```sh
yarn add --dev @testing-library/react
```

## Custom dom matchers

```sh
yarn add --dev @testing-library/jest-dom
```
