## What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for:
- JavaScript
- JSX
- TypeScript
- CSS, Less, SCSS
- HTML
- GraphQL
- Markdown
- YAML


## Why Prettier?

**To stop all the on-going debates over styles.**

It is generally accepted that having a common style guide is valuable for a project and team but getting there is a very painful and unrewarding process.

People get very emotional around particular ways of writing code and nobody likes spending time writing and receiving nits.

Prettier is the only “style guide” that is fully automatic. 

**It also helps newcomers to the codebase** quicken their ramp-up time from experienced engineers joining the company, as they likely used a different coding style before, and developers coming from a different programming language.


## Prettier vs. Linters

Linters have two categories of rules:

Formatting rules: eg: max-len, no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs, keyword-spacing, comma-style…

**Prettier alleviates the need for this whole category of rules!** 

**Use Prettier for formatting and linters for catching bugs!**
