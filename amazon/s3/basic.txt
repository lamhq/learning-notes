### How to get Access Keys for AWS Account

We recommend that you don't create access keys for your AWS account and delete any that exist. Instead, create a user in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and choose Programmatic access to create an access key for the user

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
2. In the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add user
3. Select `Programmatic access` because user require access to the API
4. Add user to existing group
5. After creating user, you can view the users' access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys)
