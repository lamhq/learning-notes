# Workflows

For software teams, we recommend these basic workflow states:

- `TO DO`: Work that has not been started
- `IN PROGRESS`: Work that is actively being looked at by the team
- `CODE REVIEW`: Work that is completed and awaiting review
- `DONE`: Work that is completely finished and meets the team's definition of done

In an issue tracker, these statuses flow from one to the next using transitions that structure the workflow.

Some software teams include additional states in their workflow that help them track the status of work more precisely.

- `AWAITING QA`: Work that has been implemented, but is still waiting for a tester review.
- `READY TO MERGE`: Code that has been reviewed and is ready to merge into the main or release branch.


## Optimize the workflow

You can create statuses for each type of work in a team's process. Ideation, design, development, code review, and test are functionally different and can be individual statuses.

Aim for a lean set of statuses that clearly communicate what phase a piece of work is in.

A well designed workflow answers the following questions:

- What work has the team completed?
- Is the backlog of work increasing or keeping pace with the team?
- How many items are in each status?
- Are there any bottlenecks that are slowing the team down?
- How long does it take to complete an average task?
- How many work items didn't pass our quality standards the first time around?

Work in progress (WIP) limits dictate a minimum and maximum number of issues in a particular state of the workflow, ensuring each state has enough work to keep the team fully utilized, but not so much that it loses focus from juggling priorities. 

Enforcing WIP limits will quickly show which processes slows overall work through the pipeline. As the team learns to optimize around its WIP limits, throughput will increase.
