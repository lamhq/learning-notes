# Ceremonies

Let's take a look at each of the agile ceremonies, and understand how they empower the team and drive agile development. 

## Sprint Planning

**Attendees**: Development team, scrum master, product owner

**When**: At the beginning of a sprint.

**Duration**: Usually up to two hours per week of iteration.

The product owner will have a prioritized product backlog. He/she discusses each item with the development team.

The development team will then make a sprint forecast outlining how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. That body of work then becomes the sprint backlog.

*Use the sprint planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done. Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the sprint.*

## Daily Stand-up

**Attendees**: Development team, scrum master, product owner

**When**: Once per day, typically in the morning.

**Duration**: No more than 15 minutes.

**Purpose**: Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. It's not a detailed status meeting. The tone should be light and fun, but informative. Have each team member answer the following questions:

- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Am I blocked by anything?


## Sprint review

**Attendees:**

- Required: Development team, scrum master, product owner
- Optional: Project stakeholders

**When**: At the end of a sprint or milestone.

**Duration**: Typically 60 minutes per week of iteration

**Purpose**: Sprint review is a time to showcase the work of the team, demonstrate work finished within the iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders.


## Sprint Retrospective

**Attendees**: Development team, scrum master, product owner

**When**: At the end of an iteration.

**Duration**: Typically 45 minutes per week of iteration.

**Purpose**: Use retrospectives to find out what's working so the team can continue to focus on those areas. Also, find out what's not working and use the time to find creative solutions and develop an action plan.
