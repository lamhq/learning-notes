# Stand-up

The daily scrum keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.

A stand-up is a daily meeting that involves the core team: product owners, developers, and the scrum master.

We use three simple questions to generate structure:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

## Stand-ups at Atlassian

- Choose a time that works for everyone: between 9 and 10 a.m
- Keep stand-up efficient. Limit the duration of stand-ups to 15 mins–max.
- Make the stand-up a part of the team’s retrospective. If the team isn’t finding value in a stand-up, discuss why. Make some changes!

## Stand-ups for distributed teams

- Have every team member join a video stand-up on their own computer.
- Reference your scrum board
