# Stand-up

The daily scrum keep everyone aware of the team’s landscape and progress.

A stand-up is a daily meeting that involves the core team: product owners, developers, and the scrum master.

We use three simple questions to generate structure:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- What issues are blocking me?

## Stand-ups at Atlassian

- Choose a time that works for everyone: between 9 and 10 a.m
- Keep stand-up efficient. Limit the duration of stand-ups to 15 mins–max.
- Make the stand-up a part of the team’s retrospective. If the team isn’t finding value in a stand-up, discuss why. Make some changes!

## Stand-ups for distributed teams

- Have every team member join a video stand-up on their own computer.
- Reference your scrum board 


# WHAT IS THE DAILY STANDUP MEETING?

Attendees (Primarily): development team

When: Once per day, typically in the morning

Duration: No more than 15 minutes. Don't book a conference room and conduct the standup sitting down. Standing up helps keep the meeting short!

Purpose: The daily standup is designed to inform everyone quickly of what's going on across the team and to plan the work of the day. It's not a full status meeting. The tone should be light and fun, but informative. Have each team member answer the following questions:

What did I complete yesterday?
What will I work on today?
Am I blocked by anything?
 
There's an implicit accountability in reporting what work you completed yesterday in front of your peers. No one wants to be the team member who is constantly doing the same thing and not making progress.

ProTip: Some teams use timers to keep everyone on track. Others toss a ball across the team to make sure everyone's paying attention. Many distributed teams use video-conferencing or group chat to close the distance gap. Your team is unique — your standup should be, too!
