# Scrum artifacts

## What are agile scrum artifacts?

Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project.

Artifacts are created during the main activities of a scrum sprint:

- Plan work and future goals
- Create tasks to achieve these goals
- Organize tasks into sprints based on dependency and priority
- Execute the tasks
- Review and analyze results in order to compare to the goals


## The main artifacts of agile scrum

### Product backlog

The product backlog is a list of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, or work requirements needed to build a product.

It is maintained and curated by the product owner between sprint cycles and as any new ideas arise.


## Sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is a set of product backlog tasks that have been promoted to be developed during the next product increment. 

Sprint backlogs are created by the development teams to plan deliverables for future increments and detail the work required to create the increment.
