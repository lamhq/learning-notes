# Scrum artifacts

## What are agile scrum artifacts?

Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project.

Artifacts are created during the main activities of a scrum sprint:

- Plan work and future goals
- Create tasks to achieve these goals
- Organize tasks into sprints based on dependency and priority
- Execute the tasks
- Review and analyze results in order to compare to the goals


## The main artifacts of agile scrum

### Product backlog

The product backlog is a list of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, or work requirements needed to build a product.

It is maintained and curated by the product owner between sprint cycles and as any new ideas arise.


### Sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is a set of product backlog tasks that have been promoted to be developed during the next product increment. 

Sprint backlogs are created by the development teams to plan deliverables for future increments and detail the work required to create the increment.  

Sprint backlogs are created by selecting a task from the product backlog and breaking that task into smaller, actionable sprint items.

*Consider an example task like “build a shopping cart page”, which requires many design and development subtasks. The product backlog is home to the primary task while the supporting tasks like “create a shopping cart visual design mockup” or “program the shopping cart sessions” are housed in the sprint backlog.*

The sprint backlog is updated during the sprint planning phase of scrum. The smaller sprint tasks are assigned to the relevant teams like design and development.

If a team does not have the capacity to deliver all the sprint tasks, the remaining sprint tasks will standby in the sprint backlog for a future sprint.


### Product increment

A product increment is the customer deliverables that were produced by completing product backlog tasks during a sprint.

An increment is decided during the sprint planning phase. An increment happens whether the team decides to release to the customer.

Product increments are incredibly useful and complementary to CI/CD in version tracking and, if needed, version rollback.


## Extended artifacts

### Burndown chart

Burndown charts are graphs that display tasks completed over the duration of a sprint.

Burndown charts are very useful in helping to gauge the active execution velocity of a team so they know whether they will complete what is planned or need to reprioritize the sprint tasks.

Over time burndown charts help teams better refine their estimates during the planning stages of scrum.


### The definition of “done”

This definition can be another type of artifact, which should be documented and shared. 

*An example definition of done for a development team is when code is covered with automated tests that match a specification and is deployed to a production environment.*

Done also defines when tasks are complete and can be closed out for burndown tracking.
