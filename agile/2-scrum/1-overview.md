# Scrum

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together.

Often thought of as an agile project management framework, scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset.

You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

**Clear communication, transparency, and a dedication to continuous improvement should always remain at the center of whatever framework you choose.**


## Scrum artifacts

Artifacts are something that we make, like a tool to solve a problem. In scrum, these three artifacts are a **product backlog**, a **sprint backlog**, and an increment with your **definition of “done”**.

### Product Backlog

Product Backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the **product owner** or **product manager**.

### Sprint Backlog

Sprint Backlog is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.

Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting, the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog.

A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, the fundamental **sprint goal** cannot be compromised.

### Increment (Sprint Goal)

Sprint Goal is the usable end-product from a sprint.

*For example, some teams choose to release something to their customers at the end of every sprint. So their definition of "done" would be "shipped".*


## Scrum ceremonies or events

Below is a list of all the key ceremonies a scrum team might partake in:

### 1. Organize the backlog

Sometimes known as backlog grooming, this event is the responsibility of the **product owner**. He/she maintains this list using feedback from users and the development team to help prioritize and keep the list clean and ready to be worked on at any given time.

### 2. Sprint planning

This meeting is led by the **scrum master** and is where the team decides on the sprint goal. Specific use stories are then added to the sprint from the product backlog.

At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment (Sprint Goal) can be delivered.

### 3. Daily scrum or stand up

This is a daily super-short meeting that happens at the same time (usually mornings). The guideline for it is about 15 minutes.

The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.

A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What do I plan to do today?
- Are there any obstacles?

### 4. Sprint review

At the end of the sprint, the team gets together for an informal session to view a demo of, or inspect, the increment

The development team showcases the backlog items that are now "Done" to stakeholders and teammates for feedback.

The product owner can decide whether or not to release the increment.

### 5. Sprint retrospective

The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in:

- a sprint
- a project
- people or relationships
- tools
- even for certain ceremonies

The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time.

## Three essential roles for scrum success

A scrum team needs three specific roles: **product owner**, **scrum master**, and **the development team**.

The development team includes testers, designers, UX specialists, and ops engineers in addition to developers.

### The scrum product owner

They are focused on understanding business, customer, and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. Effective product owners:

- Build and manage the product backlog.
- Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog.
- Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.
- Decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery.

Product owners focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business. Also, it's important that the product owner be an individual.

### The scrum master

An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow.

As the facilitator-in-chief, he/she schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.


### The scrum development team

The most effective scrum teams are tight-knit, co-located, and usually five to seven members.

All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.

## Scrum, kanban, and agile

Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done. 

Scrum is such a popular agile framework, like kanban, which is a popular alternative.

Both scrum and kanban use visual methods such as the scrum board or kanban board to track the progress of work.

Scrum focuses on smaller, fixed-length iterations. Once the time period for a sprint is finalized, the stories or product backlog entries that can be implemented during this sprint cycle are then determined.

In kanban, however, the number of tasks or the work in progress (WIP limit) to be implemented in the current cycle is fixed at first. The time taken to implement these features is then calculated backward.


## Why scrum?

The scrum framework itself is simple. 

The rules, artifacts, events, and roles are easy to understand.

The organization of complex tasks into manageable user stories makes it ideal for difficult projects.

Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
