# Scrum

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 

Often thought of as an agile project management framework, scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. 

You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

**Clear communication, transparency, and a dedication to continuous improvement should always remain at the center of whatever framework you choose.**


## Scrum artifacts

Artifacts are something that we make, like a tool to solve a problem. In scrum, these three artifacts are a **product backlog**, a **sprint backlog**, and an increment with your **definition of “done”**. 

### Product Backlog

Product Backlog is the primary list of work that needs to get done maintained by the **product owner** or **product manager**.

### Sprint Backlog

Sprint Backlog is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.

Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting, the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. 

A sprint backlog may be flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, the fundamental **sprint goal** cannot be compromised.

### Increment (Sprint Goal)

Sprint Goal is the usable end-product from a sprint. 

*For example, some teams choose to release something to their customers at the end of every sprint. So their definition of "done" would be "shipped".*
