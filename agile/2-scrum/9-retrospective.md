# Retrospectives

## Why run a retrospective?

The agile manifesto makes it clear: In order to best live the agile values, teams should meet reguarly to check in and make adjustments.


## The retrospective meeting

The purpose of the retrospective meeting is to:

- Evaluate how the last sprint, iteration, or work item went
- Articulate and stack rank the items that went well, and those items that did not.
- Create and implement a plan for improving the way the team does work.

In order for retrospectives to be successful, there needs to be a supportive atmosphere that encourages (but doesnâ€™t force) all team members to contribute.

The retrospective should be a positive, energizing experience for your team. It helps team members share important feedback, let go of frustrations, and work together to come up with solutions. 

A successful retrospective results in a list of improvements that team members take ownership of and work toward in the next sprint.

Be careful to focus not on what was delivered, but rather on how the team worked together produce it.

## How to run your first retrospective

- **When**: the retrospective should take place at the end of every sprint. Plan to spend at least thirty minutes, and up to an hour.
- **Who**: every team member should attend the retrospective, with a facilitator leading the discussion.
- **What**: 
  - **Create a short list of things that worked well and things that could be improved.** This list can be created on a whiteboard, on an Atlassian Confluence page, or maybe even sticky notes on the wall!
  - **Prioritize this list by importance as a team.**
  - **Discuss ways and tactics to improve the top two items on the "room for improvement" list**. Focus on outcomes, not actions or people, or the past.
  - **Create an action plan.** By the end of the session, the team should have produced a few actionable ideas with clear owners and due dates to address the areas of improvement. 
  - **Be disciplined about executing**. Each action item identified in the retro should have a clear owner who follows it through to completion.

## Tips

- **Vary the list prompts**:
  - Start / Stop / Continue: What the team should start doing, stop doing, and continue doing.
  - More / less: What the team needs to do more and less of.
  - Glad / Sad / Mad: What made the team glad, sad, and mad. You guessed it, focus on the sad and mad lists and how to improve so there are only items in the glad column next time.
- **Engage leadership**. After a major project has been rolled out, schedule an hour with a member of your leadership team and focus on how the team worked together
