# Scrum roles

Scrum has three roles: product owner, scrum master and the development team members.

## Scrum roles vs job titles

The three scrum roles describe the key responsibilities for those on the scrum team. They aren’t job titles. This means that any job title, even your existing ones, can perform one of the roles.

## The development team

The development team are the people that do the work. It can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc.

The development team’s responsibilities include:

- Delivering the work through the sprint.
- To ensure transparency during the sprint they meet daily at the daily scrum. The scrum master might facilitate the daily scrum, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the development team to run this meeting.


## The product owner: Setting clear direction

It is the responsibility of the product owner to ensure that they are delivering the most value.

The business is represented by the product owner who tells the development what is important to deliver.

The product owner should not only understand the customer, but also have a vision for the value the scrum team is delivering to the customer. The product owner also balances the needs of other stakeholders in the organization. So the product owner must take all these inputs and prioritize the work.

The Scrum Guide defines the product owners responsibilities as:

- Managing the scrum backlog: the product owner should know about everything that is in the backlog and other people that add items to the product backlog should ensure that they communicate with the product owner.
- Release management: Scrum teams can deliver at any time. It is important for the product owner to know when things can and should be released.
- Stakeholder management: Any product will have many stakeholders involved ranging from users, customers, governance and organizational leadership. The product owner will have to work with all these people to effectively ensure that the development team is delivering value


## The scrum master: Holding it all together

The scrum master is the role responsible for gluing everything together and ensuring that scrum is being done well.

That means they help the product owner define value, the development team deliver the value, and the scrum team to get to get better.

They serve the product owner by helping them better understand and communicate value, to manage the backlog, help them plan the work with the team and break down that work to deliver the most effective learning.

The scrum master serves the product owner in sprint planning and sprint reviews ensuring that value is clearly being described and direction set

Serving the development team, the scrum master helps them self-organize, focus on outcomes, get to a “done increment,” and manage blockers.

They serve the development team in the daily scrum by ensuring that work is happening and that blockers are being removed. 

The scrum master also serves the organization at large, helping them understand what scrum is and create an environment that supports scrum.

Ensures that retrospective has a clear set of outcomes that can be executed on.

- creating story maps
- updating confluence pages with the retrospective ideas
- coach the scrum team on breaking down work
- describing clear outcomes and reviewing those outcomes.
