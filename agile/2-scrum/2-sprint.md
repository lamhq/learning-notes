# What are sprints?

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 

With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces

## How to plan and execute scrum sprints

In order to plan your upcoming sprint, you use the sprint planning meeting! 

Sprint planning is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: **What work can get done** in this sprint and **how will the chosen work get done**?

Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the **product owner**, **scrum master**, and **development team**.

The product owner discusses the objective that the sprint should achieve and the product backlog items would achieve the sprint goal (upon completion).

The team then creates a plan for how they will build the backlog items and get them “Done” before the end of the sprint. 

The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the **sprint backlog**. By the end of sprint planning the team is ready to start work on the sprint backlog, taking items from the backlog, to “In-progress,” and “Done."

During a sprint, the team checks in during the daily scrum, or **standup**, about how the work is progressing. The goal of this meeting is to surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the teams ability to deliver the sprint goal.

After a sprint, the team demonstrates what they've completed during the **sprint review**. This is your team's opportunity to showcase their work to stakeholders and teammates before it hits production.

Round out your sprint cycle with sprint retrospective. This is your teams opportunity to identify areas of improvement for the next sprint. With that, you're ready to start your next sprint cycle.


## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured.
- Ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order.
- Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done.
- Leave out work where you won't be able to get the dependencies done *(like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off)*.
- Once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool *(like your Jira tickets)*.
- Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity, and that it reflects things like leave and team meetings.

### Don't

- Don't pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can't be completed in the sprint.
- Don't forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health.
- Don't let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint.
- Don't take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.
- If you hear concerns from the team, whether it's about velocity, low-certainty work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, don't ignore it. Address the issue, and recalibrate when necessary.


## Optimize your sprints with automation

Here are three of the most common automation rules used for sprints in Jira:

- Send a weekly Slack message with all issues still open in the sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1363405)
- When a sprint finishes, then assign outstanding issues to the next sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1357182)
- When an issue moves to 'In Progress' and the sprint is empty, then move the issue to the next active sprint. [See more](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library/rules#/rule/1309924)
