# Sprint planning

## What is sprint planning?

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint.

The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved.

Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

### The What

The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint and what backlog items contribute to that goal.

The scrum team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.

### The How

The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal. 

### The Who

The product owner defines the goal based on the value that they seek. 

The development team needs to understand how they can or cannot deliver that goal.

### The Inputs

A great starting point for the sprint plan is the product backlog.

The team should also look at the existing work done in the increment and have a view to capacity.

### The Outputs

The most important outcome for the sprint planning meeting is that the team can describe the goal of the sprint and how they will start working toward that goal. This is made visible in the sprint backlog.


## Preparation

The product owner must be prepared, combining the lessons from the previous sprint review, stakeholder feedback, and their vision for the product, so they set the scene for the sprint.

For transparency, the product backlog should be up-to-date and refined to provide clarity.


## Setting a time limit

The sprint planning meeting for a two-week sprint would be no longer than two hours.

*This is called "timeboxing", or setting a maximum amount of time for the team to accomplish a task, in this case, planning the sprint.*

## Focus on the outcomes not the work

The sprint goal describes the objective of the sprint at a high level, but the backlog Items can also be written with an outcome in mind. 

User stories are one great way of describing the work from a customer point of view. By adding clear, measurable results to the user story, the outcomes can be clearly measured, and you know when you are done.

*Don’t ignore the unknowns, they are the reality of doing difficult work. But don’t hide them by using vague words. Instead, be clear when you don’t know something and frame the work in terms of gaining an understanding.*


# WHAT IS THE SPRINT PLANNING MEETING?

Attendees: Required: development team, scrum master, product owner

When: At the beginning of a sprint.

Duration: Usually two hours per week of iteration – e.g. a two-week sprint kicks off with a four-hour planning meeting. The meeting ends when its purpose has been achieved.

Purpose: Plan the work of the sprint. The team agrees to the sprint goal and the sprint backlog.

# WHAT IS A SPRINT GOAL?

When creating a sprint, the product owner usually identifies a sprint goal. This provides a theme for the work to be completed in the sprint. A sprint goal also provides some flexibility in the number of stories that are completed in a sprint. A sprint is considered a success if the sprint goal is achieved.


## What is Agile Estimation?

Traditional software teams give estimates in a time format: days, weeks, months.

Many agile teams, however, have transitioned to story points. Story points rate the relative effort of work, often in a Fibonacci-like format: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100.
