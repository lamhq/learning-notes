## The GraphQL-first philosophy

GraphQL schema is the first thing you design, and acts as the contract between your frontend and backend

Your actual business logic, permissions, and other concerns should not be part of your GraphQL schema. For large apps, we suggest splitting your GraphQL server code into 4 components: `Schema`, `Resolvers`, `Models`, and `Connectors`, which each handle a specific part of the work. 

Use standard libraries for auth and other special concerns. Thereâ€™s no need to reinvent the login process in GraphQL


## Modularizing the schema

If your schema gets large, you may want to define parts of it in different files and import them to create the full schema

```js
// author.js
import Book from './book';

const Author = `
  type Author {
    id: Int!
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    books: [Book]
  }
`;

// we export Author and all types it depends on
// in order to make sure we don't forget to include
// a dependency and we wrap it in a function
// to avoid strings deduplication
export default () => [Author, Book];
```

```js
// book.js
import Author from './author';

const Book = `
  type Book {
    title: String
    author: Author
  }
`;

export default () => [Book, Author];
```

```js
// schema.js
import Author from './author.js';

const RootQuery = `
  type RootQuery {
    author(id: Int!): Author
  }
`;

const SchemaDefinition = `
  schema {
    query: RootQuery
  }
`;

export default makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: [SchemaDefinition, RootQuery, Author],
  resolvers: {},
});
```

You can do the same thing with resolvers - just pass around multiple resolver objects, and at the end combine them together into a plain array. They will be deeply merged by `makeExecutableSchema`.

```js
import { resolvers as gitHubResolvers } from './github/schema';
import { resolvers as sqlResolvers } from './sql/schema';

const rootResolvers = { ... };

// resolvers will be merged together by makeExecutableSchema.
const resolvers = [rootResolvers, gitHubResolvers, sqlResolvers];
```


## Combine multiple resolvers into one

The following is an example of a simple logged-in authorization logic:

```js
const isAuthenticated = (root, args, context, info) => {
  if (!context.user) {
    return new Error('Not authenticated')
  }
}
```

Which could be used it in an actual field resolver like this:

```js
import { combineResolvers } from 'graphql-resolvers'

const protectedField = (root, args, context, info) => 'Protected field value'

const resolverMap = {
  Query: {
    protectedField: combineResolvers(
      isAuthenticated,
      protectedField
    )
  }
}
```
