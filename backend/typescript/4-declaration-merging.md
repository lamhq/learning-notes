# Declaration Merging

## Introduction

Declaration merging means that the compiler merges two separate declarations declared with the same name into a single definition. This merged definition has the features of both of the original declarations.


## Merging Interfaces

```ts
interface Box {
  height: number;
  width: number;
}

interface Box {
  scale: number;
}

let box: Box = { height: 5, width: 6, scale: 10 };
```


## Merging Namespaces

To merge the namespaces, type definitions from exported interfaces declared in each namespace are themselves merged, forming a single namespace with merged interface definitions inside.

To merge the namespace value, at each declaration site, if a namespace already exists with the given name, it is further extended by taking the existing namespace and adding the exported members of the second namespace to the first.

```ts
namespace Animals {
  export class Zebra {}
}

namespace Animals {
  export interface Legged {
    numberOfLegs: number;
  }
  export class Dog {}
}
```

is equivalent to:

```ts
namespace Animals {
  export interface Legged {
    numberOfLegs: number;
  }
  export class Zebra {}
  export class Dog {}
}
```

Non-exported members are only visible in the original (un-merged) namespace. 


## Module Augmentation

```ts
// observable.ts
export class Observable<T> {
  // ... implementation left as an exercise for the reader ...
}

// map.ts
import { Observable } from "./observable";

declare module "./observable" {
  interface Observable<T> {
    map<U>(f: (x: T) => U): Observable<U>;
  }
}

Observable.prototype.map = function (f) {
  // ... another exercise for the reader
};

// consumer.ts
import { Observable } from "./observable";
import "./map";
let o: Observable<number>;
o.map((x) => x.toFixed());
```

There are two limitations to keep in mind:

1. You can't declare new top-level declarations in the augmentation â€” just patches to existing declarations.
2. Default exports also cannot be augmented, only named exports (since you need to augment an export by its exported name, and `default` is a reserved word)


## Global augmentation

```ts
// observable.ts
export class Observable<T> {
  // ... still no implementation ...
}

declare global {
  interface Array<T> {
    toObservable(): Observable<T>;
  }
}

Array.prototype.toObservable = function () {
  // ...
};
```

Global augmentations have the same behavior and limits as module augmentations.
