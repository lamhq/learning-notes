# Types of Data

## Data

Data is a collection of:
- numbers, characters (eg. Financial statements)
- words/text (EG. Analysis reports or social media),
- images (maybe from satellites),
- audio collected by your smart speakers,
- video collected by your smart doorbells.


## Data Types

### Numerical (quantitative)

- Continuous: data that can take any numerical value within a specified range (Ex. temperature, height, weight)
- Discrete: Data resulting from a counting process (Ex. frequency of discrete compounding, money)

### Categorical (qualitative)

- Nominal: Data that cannot be organized into a logical order (Ex. industry classification of stocks, telecom, energy)
- Ordinal: Data that can be logically organized or ranked (Ex. ranking investment funds, 5 star to 1 star)

### Cross sectional

Observations of one variable for different units at a given point in time (Ex. January inflation rates for different countries)

### Time series

Observations for a single unit of one variable collected over time (Ex. Daily closing prices of a particular stock)

### Panel Data

A mix of time-series and cross sectional data

Panel data consist of observations through time on one or more variables for multiple observational units. 

Ex. data table showing EPS over time for a number of companies

### Structured

Structured data is highly organized in a predefined manner usually with repeating patterns.

Examples include:
- market data such as that issued by stock exchanges, EG, closing prices and daily volumes.
- Fundamental data such as that contained in financial statements, EG. Assets and liabilities etcetera.
- Analytical data. Which is data derived from analytics. EG, financial ratios.

### Unstructured

Unstructured data does not follow any conventionally organized form and includes data produced by individuals such as social media posts.

### Data Table

- One-Dimension array: This is time-series data and tabulating it in this way facilitates analysis, such as identifying trends
- Two-Dimension array: consists of columns and rows
