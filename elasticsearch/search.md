# Search

## Search response

- `hits`: contains the `total` number of documents that matched our query, and a `hits` array containing the first 10 of those matching documents.
- `took`: how many milliseconds the entire search request took to execute.
- `shards`: the total number of `shards` that were involved in the query and, of them, how many were `successful` and how many `failed`.
- `timeout`: whether the query timed out


## Search in multiple indices

```
GET /_search
GET /_all/_search
GET /gb,us/_search
GET /g*,u*/_search
GET /gb,us/user,tweet/_search
```


## Pagination
- `size`: Indicates the number of results that should be returned, defaults to 10
- `from`: Indicates the number of initial results that should be skipped, defaults to 0

```
GET /_search?size=5&from=10
```

## Compound queries

### Boolean

The bool filter is used to combine multiple filter clauses using Boolean logic. It accepts three parameters:

- `must`: These clauses must match, like `and`.
- `filter`: These clauses must match, like `and`. However, filter clauses are executed in filter context, meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching.
- `should`: At least one of these clauses must match, like `or`.
- `must_not`: These clauses must not match, like `not`.

```
POST _search
{
  "query": {
    "bool" : {
      "must" : {
        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }
      },
      "filter": {
        "term" : { "tag" : "tech" }
      },
      "must_not" : {
        "range" : {
          "age" : { "gte" : 10, "lte" : 20 }
        }
      },
      "should" : [
        { "term" : { "tag" : "wow" } },
        { "term" : { "tag" : "elasticsearch" } }
      ],
      "minimum_should_match" : 1,
      "boost" : 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

### Boosting

Returns documents matching a positive query while reducing the relevance score of documents that also match a negative query.

You can use the boosting query to demote certain documents without excluding them from the search results.

```
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "boosting" : {
            "positive" : {
                "term" : {
                    "text" : "apple"
                }
            },
            "negative" : {
                 "term" : {
                     "text" : "pie tart fruit crumble tree"
                }
            },
            "negative_boost" : 0.5
        }
    }
}
```


### Disjunction max

Returns documents matching one or more wrapped queries, called query clauses or clauses.

```
GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "dis_max" : {
            "queries" : [
                { "term" : { "title" : "Quick pets" }},
                { "term" : { "body" : "Quick pets" }}
            ],
            "tie_breaker" : 0.7
        }
    }
}
```


### term Filter

The `term` filter is used to filter by exact values

```json
{ "term": { "age": 26 }}
```


### terms Filter

The `terms` filter is the same as the term filter, but allows you to specify multiple values to match

```json
{ "terms": { "tag": [ "search", "full_text", "nosql" ] }}
```


### range Filter

The `range` filter allows you to find numbers or dates that fall into a specified range:

```json
{ "range": { "age": { "lte":23, "gt":20 } } }
```

### exists and missing Filters

The `exists` and `missing` filters are used to find documents in which the specified field either has one or more values (`exists`) or doesnâ€™t have any values (`missing`).

```json
{
    "exists": {
        "field": "title"
    }
}
```

### match Query

query for a full-text on a text field

```json
{ "match": { "tweet": "About Search" }}
```


### multi_match Query

The multi_match query allows to run the same match query on multiple fields:

```json
{
    "multi_match": {
        "query": "full text search", "fields": ["title","body"]
    }
}
```

## Combine query and filter

This query search for account which `address` contains words `490` or `street` and `age` is `22`, while exclude account whose `firstname` contains `Keri`

```
GET /bank/account/_search
{
    "from": 0,
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
    	"bool": {
    		"must": [
    			{ "match": { "address": "490 street" } },
    			{ "term": { "age": 22 } }
    		],
    		"must_not": { "match": { "firstname": "Keri" } }
    	}
    },
    "sort": [
    	{ "balance": { "order": "desc" } },
        { "_score": { "order": "desc" }}
    ],
    "highlight": {
        "fields": {
            "address": {}
        }
    }
}
```


## Validating Queries

```json
GET /gb/tweet/_validate/query?explain
{
    "query": {
        "tweet" : {
            "match" : "really powerful"
        }
    }
}
```
