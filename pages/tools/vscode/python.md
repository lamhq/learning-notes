## Test

The Python extension provides robust testing support for [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/unittest.html) and [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/7.4.x/).

You can configure Python tests through the Testing view on the Activity Bar by selecting **Configure Python Tests** and selecting your test framework of choice.

## Create virtual environment

VS Code can create a python virtual environment from your `requirements.txt` without you to run the `venv` command.

Create a virtual environment by opening the Command Palette and running the **Python: Create Environment** command.
