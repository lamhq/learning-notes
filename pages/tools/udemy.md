## Always Login with Email & Password

**Problem:** Logging into Udemy from a laptop or PC will use password-less authentication, which require you to enter a one-time password (OTP) sent to your email. This is very annoying.

**Expectations**: You want to always log in with your email and password, which can be autofilled by your browser, eliminating the need to go to your email and copy the OTP code.
