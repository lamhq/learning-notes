# System design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase.

The desired outcome is to come up with an architecture that achieves system design goals with acceptable tradeoffs.
