# Design Patterns

## Benefits

Design Patterns help us structure our own applications in ways that are easier to understand, more maintainable, and more flexible.

Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.

Design Patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developers.


## Tips

The best way to use patterns is to:
1. Load your brain with them (learn all of them)
2. Recognize places where you can apply them (in your designs and existing applications)
