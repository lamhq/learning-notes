# Design Patterns

## Overview

Design patterns are ways of constructing object-oriented systems that are maintainable, reusable, and flexible (can cope with change).

Patterns aren’t invented, they are discovered.

Patterns are not frameworks or libraries. Patterns don’t give you code, they give you general solutions to design problems. Instead of code reuse, with patterns you get experience reuse.


## Benefits

By knowing patterns, you can skip the hard work of figuring out solutions and jump straight to designs that always work.

Patterns provide a shared language that can maximize the value of your communication with other developers.


## Why do i need Design Patterns?

Knowing the OO basics (abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) does not make good OO designs.

Good OO designs are reusable, extensible, and maintainable.

Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities.


## Tips

The best way to use patterns is to:
1. Load your brain with them (learn all of them)
2. Recognize places where you can apply them (in your designs and existing applications)

When you can’t find a pattern that matches your problem, there are some object-oriented principles underlie the patterns will help you to cope.

One of the secrets to creating maintainable OO systems is thinking about how they might change in the future, object-oriented principles can address those issues.
