# Object-oriented programming

## Overview

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, into special bundles called **objects**, which are constructed from a set of "blueprints", defined by a programmer, called **classes**.


## Pillars of OOP

Object-oriented programming is based on four pillars (concepts) that differentiate it from other programming paradigms:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
