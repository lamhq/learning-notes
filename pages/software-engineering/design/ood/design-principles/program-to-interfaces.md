# Program to interfaces

## Overview

***Program to an interface, not an implementation***.

This design principle encourages writting code that rely on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than implementations (concrete classes).

For example, when you use the `new` operator you are certainly instantiating a concrete class, so thatâ€™s definitely an implementation and not an interface.


## Benefits

**Clearer Contracts**: Interfaces define clear contracts for what are expected, making the code more understandable and self-documenting.

**Maintainability**: Code that depends on interfaces is generally easier to maintain. Changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts.

**Testability**: Interfaces make it easier to write unit tests. You can create mock implementations of the interface to test the function in isolation.

**Decoupling**: By depending on an interface, the function is decoupled from the specific implementation. This reduces dependencies and makes the code more modular.


## Rethink

Let's say your code depends on a class (instead of an interface):
- When that class changes, you need to review every change (methods and attributes) to see if you're referencing them in your code; then, possibly, a refactor is required.
- You're forced to use instances of that class or its subclasses in your code, which reduces flexibility


## Example

We have a function `makePayment` that process payments from users, it need a payment processor to work:

```ts
interface PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void;
}

function makePayment(processor: PaymentProcessor, amount: number): void {
  processor.processPayment(amount);
}
```

There can be many concrete implementations of the `PaymentProcessor` interface, but the developer working on the `makePayment` function only cares about the methods from the interface.
```tsx
class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    // ...
  }

  // other attributes/methods ...
}

class StripeProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    // ...
  }

  // other attributes/methods ...
}

// Usage
const paypalProcessor = new PayPalProcessor();
const stripeProcessor = new StripeProcessor();

makePayment(paypalProcessor, 100);
makePayment(stripeProcessor, 100);
```
