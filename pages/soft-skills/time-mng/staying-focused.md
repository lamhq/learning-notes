# Staying Focused

## External

- Better to have a organized workspace
- Communicate your needs to be left alone, put up a **"do not disturb"** sign on your office
- Don't open up too many windows, programs on your laptop
- Keep your phone away, mute it, no checking Facebook, ..
- Set deadlines with things that you want to work
- Use Promodoro technique:
  - set a timer for 25 minutes to focus solely on the task
  - take a 5-minute break after the timer rings
  - do that 4 times
  - after that, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)
- Do a quick walk if you find yourself losing focus
- Music without lyrics helps you focus: jazz
- Remind of things that you've accomplished in the past helps you create more success


## Internal

Common causes of internal distraction:
- Low stimulation activities: leads to boredom
- Hight stimulation activities: leads to stress and anxiety. Can be addictive, causing a feeling that you cannot stop

You can **balanced stimulation** by:
- Alternate high stimulation and low stimulation activities
- Make your low stimulation activities more lively:
  - do them standing up
  - playing games
- Make your high stimulation activities less stressful:
  - take a break before and after
  - break down the tasks

**Have 2 todo lists**:
- Primary: This is your comprehensive to-do list that includes everything you need to work on. It helps you keep track of all your tasks and ensures nothing is forgotten.
- Secondary: This is a more focused list that contains only the 2 most important tasks you need to do right now. By concentrating on just these two tasks, you can work more efficiently and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

**Train Your Brain**: MEDITATION is a tool for trainging your brain to remain calm and allow you to focus your thoughts in the direction of your choosing.
