# Planning

## Focusing on Outcomes

The reason that makes you feel busy but not getting much done and not getting closer to your goals is **missing understanding of WHY you're doing the task**.

A completed task is not the outcome.

Ask your self:
- "What's OUTCOME you're hoping to achieve?"
- "What do you really want?"

**The goals you set must capture the OUTCOMES you want.**

**The tasks are the strategies you make to achieve your goals.**

> For example, a saleperson made a goal: "i'm going to make 4 phone calls a day in this week".
>
> He may not actually achieve what he really wanted: "make 2 sales for the week".
> 
> The phone calls is the strategy, not the goal.


## Creating a Weekly Todo List

1. Determine **WHERE** you'll put your todo list. It need to be visible and easily accessible.
   - white board
   - wall in your room
   - in a task app in phone and computer
2. Choose a time that you will plan the coming week's tasks (20-30 minutes)
   - *i will create my weekly plan every Monday at 7pm*

### Week plan
1. List all the tasks/activities you'll need to do this week
2. Identify task's priority (hight, medium, low), plan to do the high priority first
3. Schedule tasks that are time-framed
4. Assign other tasks to specific days of the week

### Day plan
1. Plan your day **the day before**
2. Look at your tasks and outcome for the week
3. Choose 3-5 tasks that will make you feel like it was a successful day when accomplished
4. For each task, remind yourself the outcome from the accompishment of **the task and the bigger-picture goal**
5. Schedule in appointments
6. Do MUST and time-sensitive tasks **first**.
7. When new needs arise, if they're not higher priority than your current focused tasks, add them to your weekly list and do NOT work on them today
