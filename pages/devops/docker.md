# Docker

## Overview

Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, run, update, and manage applications in containers.

Docker makes it easy to create, package, deploy, and run containers.

It includes various tools and components like Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Compose, and Docker Desktop.


## Docker Engine

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for creating and running Docker containers.

It comprise:
- Docker daemon: a server that performs container management `dockerd`
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client `docker`.

Docker Engine is the core part of the Docker platform.


## Installations

Docker Desktop is not free for companies with more than 250 employees or annual revenue exceeding $10 million are required to have a paid subscription.

Alternatives:
- Podman is a quick substitute, but required a lot of tedious changes and extra setup, not really a "Docker replacement"
