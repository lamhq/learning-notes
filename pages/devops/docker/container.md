# Container

A container is a standardized unit that packages up your code and all of its dependencies. This package is designed to run reliably on any platform, because the container creates its own independent environment.

This makes it easy to carry workloads from one place to another, such as from development to production or from on-premises to the cloud.


## Containers vs Virtual Machines?

Containers share the same operating system and kernel as the host they exist on, whereas virtual machines contain their operating system.

Since each virtual machine has to maintain a copy of an operating system, there's a degree of wasted space.

A container is more lightweight. They spin up quicker, almost instantly.

While containers can provide speed, virtual machines offer you the full strength of an operating system and offer more resources, like package installation, a dedicated kernel, and more.
