# Cloud Service Models

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the internet to the end user without local installation.

Using a SaaS product, customers don't have to manage anything at all, they simply use the application.

Characteristics:
- Customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time

Examples:
- Zoom
- Dropbox
- Mailchimp
- Slack
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs and Drive)
- Salesforce
- Cisco WebEx
- Concur
- GoToMeeting.

Use cases:
- Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don't have time for server issues or software
- Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration
- Applications that aren't needed too often
- Applications that need both web and mobile access


Limitations:
- Interoperability. Integration with existing apps and services
- Vendor lock-in
- Lack of integration support
- Data security
- Customization
- Lack of control
- Feature limitations.
- Performance and downtime.


## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Offers a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud.

PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can use to create customized applications.

Customers manage the application and data on a platform.

Service provider manage the runtime, middleware, OS, virtualization, servers, storage, network.

Characteristics:
- Customers pay for the resources they actually use
- Resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
- Integrates web services and databases

Limitations:
- Data security
- Integrations
- Vendor lock-in
- Customization of legacy systems
- Runtime issues
- Operational limitation

Examples:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Google App Engine
- Heroku
- OpenShift


## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS rovides on-demand infrastructure resources via the cloud, including compute, storage, networking, and virtualization.

Customers are responsible for managing aspects such as applications, data, virtual machines, runtime, middleware, OS.

Service Providers manage the virtualization, servers, storage, networking.

Examples:
- Amazon EC2
- Google Compute Engine
- Azure Virtual Machines


## Function as a Service (FaaS)

A cloud computing service that allows you to execute code (functions) in response to events.

You will be responsible for managing only the application.

Everything else is managed by service provider.

Examples:
- AWS Lambda
- Google Cloud Functions
- Azure Functions
