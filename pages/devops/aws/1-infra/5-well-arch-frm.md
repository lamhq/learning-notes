# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS.

It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

The framework documents a set of foundational questions that help you to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices.

It is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members.

It describes AWS best practices and strategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides links to further implementation details and architectural patterns.

The **AWS Well-Architected Tool** (AWS WA Tool) is a cloud service that provides a consistent process for reviewing and measuring your architecture. It provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective


The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars:

## Operational Excellence

Running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures


## Security

Protecting information and systems

Best practices:
- Automate security best practices when possible.
- Apply security at all layers.
- Protect data in transit and at rest.


## Reliability

Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.


## Performance Efficiency

Using IT and computing resources efficiently.


## Cost Optimization

Avoiding unnecessary costs.


## Sustainability

Minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

To facilitate good design for sustainability:
- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
