# Cost Optimization

## Overview

Cost optimization is the continuous optimization of your spending in the cloud.

Efficient cost management and optimization prevent overspending and ensure your environment remains affordable as demand grows.


## Best practices

- **Practicing Cloud Financial Management**: Quantify business value while optimizing costs, usage, and scalability in AWS.
- **Expenditure and Usage Awareness**: Monitor usage and costs to reduce waste by decommissioning resources and maintaining governance best practices.
- **Cost-Effective Resources**: Optimize costs by choosing the correct pricing model, resource type, and services for your use case.
- **Manage Demand and Supply Resources**: Analyze your workload and utilize scaling, queues, throttling, or buffers to eliminate costly or wasteful over-provisioning.
- **Optimizing Over Time**: Review your usage and costs regularly to use updated features and new services as they become available.
