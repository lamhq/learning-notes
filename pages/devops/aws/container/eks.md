# Amazon EKS

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an opensource container orchestration software.

It is perfect for extremely large-scale complex operation with hundreds of thousands of containers

Using Kubernetes, you're not locked into the vendor like ECS.

A lot of the time, Kubernetes will likely be overkill
for a majority of users' needs.


## Overview

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to **run Kubernetes on AWS** without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

Amazon EKS is conceptually similar to Amazon ECS, but there are some differences:
- An EC2 instance with the ECS Agent installed and configured is called a container instance. In Amazon EKS, it is called a worker node.
- An ECS Container is called a task. In EKS, it is called a pod.
- ECS runs on AWS, EKS runs on top of Kubernetes.

Amazon EKS offers the following features:

- It runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
- It also automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and provides automated version updates and patching for them.
- It runs up-to-date versions of Kubernetes, so you can use all of the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community.
- It is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, including the following capabilities:
  - Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR for container images).
  - Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution.
  - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for authentication.
  - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for isolation.


## ECS vs. EKS

| Amazon ECS | Amazon EKS |
|---|---|
| AWS-specific platform that supports Docker Containers | Compatible with upstream Kubernetes so itâ€™s easy to lift and shift from other Kubernetes deployments |
| Simpler and easier to use | Feature-rich, complex with a steep learning curve |
| Best used when you're all in on AWS | Perfect for significantly larger workloads. |
| Leverages AWS services like Route 53, ALB, and CloudWatch | A hosted Kubernetes platform that handles many things internally |
| "Tasks" are instances of containers that are run on underlying compute but more of less isolated | "Pods" are containers collocated with one another and can have shared access to each other |
| Limited extensibility | Extensible via a wide variety of third-party and community add-ons. |
