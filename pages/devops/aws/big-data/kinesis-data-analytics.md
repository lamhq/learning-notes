# Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics

## Overview

We can use Kinesis Data Analytics to **process information using standard SQL**.

Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics allows real-time transformation and analysis of streaming data using Apache Flink (Apache Flink is an open-source framework and engine for processing data streams).

**Easy**. It's very simple to tie Data Analytics into your Kinesis pipeline. It's directly supported by Data Firehose and Data Streams.

**No Servers**. It will automatically handle scaling and provisioning of needed resources.

**Cost**. You only pay for the amount of resources you consume as your data passes through.
