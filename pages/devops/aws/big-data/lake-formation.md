# AWS Lake Formation

## Overview

AWS Lake Formation lets you create a data lake from all of your data regardless of whether it's stored on AWS or on-premises.

It uses AWS Glue to perform ETL operations and import data.

It can automatically label ingested data. The AWS Glue Data Catalog stores metadata about the data lake, including labels.

It can help deduplicate data in multiple databases.
