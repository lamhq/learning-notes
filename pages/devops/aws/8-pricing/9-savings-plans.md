# Savings Plans

## Overview

Savings Plans offer flexible pricing models for up to 72% savings on compute!

Savings Plans provide you lower prices for EC2 instances regardless of instance family, size, Os, tenancy, or Regions.

Can also apply to AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate usage.

They also offer SageMaker plans for lowering
Amazon SageMaker instance pricing.

Savings are provided as a trade for long-term commitments.
There are one-year or three-year pricing options.

You can choose to pay all upfront,
which gives you the greatest amount of savings,
partial upfront, or even no money upfront.
