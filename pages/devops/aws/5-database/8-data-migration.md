# AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.

With AWS DMS, you move data between a source database and a target database.
 
During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database.

> For example, you can migrate your data from a MySQL database that is stored on premises in an Amazon EC2 instance to an Amazon Aurora database.


## Other use cases for AWS DMS

### Development and test database migrations

Enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users

### Database consolidation

Combining several databases into a single database

### Continuous replication

Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration
