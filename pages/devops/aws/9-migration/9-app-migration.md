# AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN)

## Overview

AWS MGN is an automated lift-and-shift service for expediting migration of apps to AWS.

It enables companies to lift-and-shift
a large number of physical, virtual, or cloud servers to avoid cutover windows or disruptions.

MGN replicates source servers into AWS, and automatically converts and launches on AWS to migrate quickly.
