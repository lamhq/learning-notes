# Pricing

You pay only for the API calls you receive, and the amount of data transferred out.

No minimum fees or upfront commitments.

There are no data transfer out charges for Private APIs (however, AWS PrivateLink charges apply when using Private APIs in Amazon API Gateway).

Amazon API Gateway also provides optional data caching charged at an hourly rate that varies based on the cache size you select.

The API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls per month for up to 12 months.
