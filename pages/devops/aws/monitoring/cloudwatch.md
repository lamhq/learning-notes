## CloudWatch Dashboards

The CloudWatch dashboard feature enables you to access all the metrics for your resources from a single location. 

You can pull data from different Regions into a single dashboard in order to create a global view of your architecture.

> For example, you can use a CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU utilization of an Amazon EC2 instance, the total number of requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket, and more.
>
> You can even customize separate dashboards for different business purposes, applications, or resources.
