# Metrics

## Overview

Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions and reports metrics through CloudWatch.

Lambda tracks the number of requests, the latency per request, and the number of requests resulting in an error.

You can view the request rates and error rates using the AWS Lambda Console, the CloudWatch console, and other AWS resources.

To monitor a function:
- Open the Lambda console Functions page.
- Choose a function.
- Choose Monitoring.
