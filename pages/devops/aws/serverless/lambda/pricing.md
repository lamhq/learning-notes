## Pricing

Priced based on:
- Number of requests.
- Duration of the request calculated from the time your code begins execution until it returns or terminates.
- The amount of memory allocated to the function.

Free tier of 1,000,000 requests and 400,000 GBs of compute per month.

It can be very cost effective to run functions whose execution time is very low, such as functions with durations under 100ms or low latency APIs.
