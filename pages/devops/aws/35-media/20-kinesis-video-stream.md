# Amazon Kinesis Video Streams

## Overview

Kinesis Video Streams allows users to **stream media content** from a large number of devices **to AWS** and then **run analytics**, machine learning (ML), playback, and other processing (a perfect example of this is Ring).

Kinesis Video Streams elastically scales to millions of devices and then stores, encrypts, and indexes video data in your streams.

Data can be accesses through APIs.

Supports playback of both live and on-demand video viewing.

Supports WebRTC, allowing real-time media streaming and interaction between web browsers, mobile apps, and connected devices (WebRTC is commonly used for activities like video chat and peer-to-peer media streaming).


## Use cases

- **Smart Home**. Think Amazon Ring. You can stream video content from your Ring devices to Kinesis Video Streams and then run analysis on the data.
- **Smart City**. Many cities have devices like CCTV cameras at traffic lights and junctions that can be monitored automatically using Kinesis Streams.
- **Industrial Automation**. You can use Kinesis Streams to ingest time-encoded data (e.g., LIDAR and RADAR signals and temperature sensors) and then provide industrial automation.
