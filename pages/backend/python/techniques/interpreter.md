# Python Interpreter

The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time.

The Python interpreter can be invoked on the command line with the `python` command:
```shell
python
```

To exit the Python interpreter, you can either type `exit()` or press `Ctrl-D` (Linux and macOS only).

Python programs can be run by calling `python` with a `.py` file as its first argument:
```shell
python hello_world.py
```
