# Code style

You don't need to remember these rules, linter will check the code style for you:

- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
- Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
- Use docstrings
- Use spaces around operators and after commas
- Class name: `UpperCamelCase`
- Class methods, functions, variable: `lowercase_with_underscores`
