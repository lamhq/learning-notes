# Logging

## Overview

The `logging` module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.


## Getting started

You can access logging functionality by creating a logger by calling `logging.getLogger(__name__)` then calling the logger’s methods.

```py
import logging

# show logs of INFO and DEBUG levels
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# get the logger for the current module
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# set module's log level
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)

# set log format
file_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter(
    '%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(name)s : %(message)s'
))

# add file handler to logger
logger.addHandler(logging.FileHandler('logfile.log'))

logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("critical message: %s", "error message")
```


## Logging Levels

There're several log levels, each associated with a specific severity.

Here are the standard log levels, in increasing order of severity:
1. **DEBUG**: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
2. **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
3. **WARNING**: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., disk space low). The software is still working as expected.
4. **ERROR**: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
5. **CRITICAL**: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

By default, the logging level is set to `WARNING`, meaning that only `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` messages will be logged unless you change the level.

You can set the log level using the `setLevel()` method. For example:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the log level to DEBUG
```


## Customize module's logging

Customize other module's logging behavior from the main module.

Suppose we have the following files:
```
.
├── code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── lib.py
└── main.py
```

```py filename="code/lib.py"
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def do_sth():
    logger.debug("This is a debug message")
    logger.info("This is an info message")
    logger.warning("This is a warning message")
    logger.error("This is an error message")
    logger.critical("critical message: %s", "error message")
```

```py filename="main.py"
import logging
from code.lib import do_sth

# show logs of INFO and DEBUG levels
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

logger = logging.getLogger('code.lib')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

do_sth()
```

## Log to file

Write log to a file instead of the console.
```py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, file='sample.log')
```


## Log format

```py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO, 
    format='%(asctime)s :: %(levelname)s :: %(message)s'
)
logging.info("Just like that!")
# 2019-02-17 11:40:38,254 :: INFO :: Just like that!
```


## Include traceback info

Include traceback information in logged messages.

```py
import logging

# Create or get the logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# set log level
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def divide(x, y):
    try:
        out = x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logger.exception("Division by zero problem")
    else:
        return out

# Logs
logger.error("Divide {x} / {y} = {c}".format(x=10, y=0, c=divide(10,0)))

#> ERROR:__main__:Division by zero problem
#> Traceback (most recent call last):
#>   File "<ipython-input-16-a010a44fdc0a>", line 12, in divide
#>     out = x / y
#> ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
#> ERROR:__main__:None
```
