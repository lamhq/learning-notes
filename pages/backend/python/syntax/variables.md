# Variables

```py
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

You will get an error if trying to used a variable that is not "defined" (assigned a value).

```py
>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'n' is not defined
```
