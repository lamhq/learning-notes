# Getting started

## Installation

Install FastAPI framework:

```shell
pip install fastapi
```

Install Uvicorn web server:

```shell
pip install uvicorn
```


## Write code

```py filename="hello.py"
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hi")
def greet():
    return "Hello? World?"

The functions that map URLs to code are called **path functions**.

In above example, `greet` is a path function.
