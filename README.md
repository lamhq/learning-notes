# Tech Notes

## Overview

Welcome to my personal repository of learning programming! Here, I store all of my helpful notes, code snippets, and tutorials in one convenient location. This way, whenever I forget a command or need a reference for certain code, I can easily access it without having to search online.

Additionally, this repository serves as a great tool for reviewing my knowledge. Instead of reading through long official documentation again, I can simply revisit my notes and quickly refresh my memory.
